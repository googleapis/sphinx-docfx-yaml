      \ to deliver the associated message to a subscriber.\n   \n   More precisely,\
      \ this is 1 + (number of NACKs) + (number of\n   ack_deadline exceeds) for this\
      \ message.\n   \n   A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline.\n\
      \   An ack_deadline exceeds event is whenever a message is not\n   acknowledged\
      \ within ack_deadline. Note that ack_deadline is\n   initially Subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds,\
      \ but may get\n   extended automatically by the client library.\n   \n   Upon\
      \ the first delivery of a given message,\n   <code>delivery_attempt</code> will\
      \ have a value of 1. The value is\n   calculated at best effort and is approximate.\n\
      \   \n   If a DeadLetterPolicy is not set on the subscription, this\n   will\
      \ be 0."
