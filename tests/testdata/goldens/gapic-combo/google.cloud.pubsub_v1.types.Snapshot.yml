      \ source subscription.\n   Specifically, the lifetime of the snapshot is\n \
      \  <code>7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)</code>.\n\
      \   For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked\n   message is\
      \ 3 days old. If a snapshot is created from this\n   subscription, the snapshot\
      \ -- which will always capture this\n   3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot\
      \ exists -- will\n   expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a\n\
      \   snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after\n   creation."

  summary: 'A snapshot resource. Snapshots are used in

    `Seek <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview>`__

    operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in

    bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in

    an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot.
