  summary: 'A policy that specifies how Cloud Pub/Sub retries message delivery.


    Retry delay will be exponential based on provided minimum and

    maximum backoffs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff.


    RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline

    exceeded events for a given message.


    Retry Policy is implemented on a best effort basis. At times, the

    delay between consecutive deliveries may not match the

    configuration. That is, delay can be more or less than configured

    backoff.
