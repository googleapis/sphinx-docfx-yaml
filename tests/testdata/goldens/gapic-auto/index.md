## Quick Start

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:


1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)


2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)


3. [Enable the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)


4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html)

### Installation

Install this library in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) using pip. [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), itâ€™s possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

### Code samples and snippets

Code samples and snippets live in the samples/ folder.

#### Supported Python Versions

Our client libraries are compatible with all current [active](https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#in-development-main-branch) and [maintenance](https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#maintenance-branches) versions of
Python.

Python >= 3.7

#### Unsupported Python Versions

Python <= 3.6

If you are using an [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches)
version of Python, we recommend that you update as soon as possible to an actively supported version.
